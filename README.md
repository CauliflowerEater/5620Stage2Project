In this project, we innovatively designed an intelligent bookkeeping and financial advice analysis application that combines a large language model (LLM). It will generate detailed financial status and financial advice reports based on the information provided by the user. The development of this project follows an agile and open process and incorporates advanced technologies, leaving a lot of room for expansion for the technical team.
Based on the first phase of the architecture design, the application provides basic bookkeeping functions as well as artificial intelligence financial reports. Users can easily manage their financial records and get smart customized advice for their financial situation.
At the same time, the application uses LLM to analyze financial data and generate comprehensive reports. This feature enhances the application's ability to interpret data, make suggestions, and help users make wise financial decisions, effectively adding value beyond standard bookkeeping tools.
During the development process, our team always follows an agile approach. By combining iterative development cycles, feedback loops, and regular team collaboration, we ensure continuous improvement and response to feedback to create products that meet changing needs and user expectations.
To support the functionality and performance of the application, the user interface of the program is built using React in the front-end and back-end frameworks to achieve a responsive and interactive user experience, while the back-end is powered by Express.
At the same time, cloud services ensure smooth deployment and efficient data processing. In this part, we used AWS for scalable and reliable cloud hosting. In terms of deployment and CI/CD, we used Docker to manage continuous integration and deployment, so as to achieve seamless updates and reliable performance in different environments. Finally, optical character recognition (OCR) technology was used to automatically extract data from physical receipts and documents, which greatly facilitated users to record their daily consumption habits.


# Advanced Technologies
- React: This tool helps build the parts of the software that users interact with, making it feel fast and responsive. When users click through to view reports or input expenses, React keeps things snappy and easy to navigate.

- Express: Express helps us set up my backend quickly, handling routes, requests, and responses. It makes managing data and building APIs easy, so I can focus more on my app's features than on server details.

- AWS: This is the cloud service where the software’s data (like records, backups, etc.) can be safely stored and accessed. Using AWS makes it easy to scale up if lots of people are using the app, or if a user’s data grows over time without slowing things down.

- MongoDB: This is where all the app’s data is stored in a flexible format, which is especially handy when dealing with varied information like transaction notes, receipt images, and more. It keeps everything organized and easy to search.

- Docker: Ensures the app runs consistently across different computers. When updating or fixing, Docker lets us test in a secure “bubble,” reducing unexpected issues.

- OCR: Reads text from images, like receipts. This helps users by letting them snap a photo, and OCR automatically grabs the important details, saving time and cutting down on manual entry mistakes.

- Mongoose: Works with MongoDB in Node.js projects, letting us set up data templates (“schemas”) to keep things organized and consistent. It simplifies database actions like creating and updating data.

- Swagger: Makes it easy for both the team and financial institutions to understand and use our API. It provides clear, testable documentation, helping everyone work together smoothly and integrate confidently.
